thoughts and experiences the user has. Posts can contain text as well as a picture and they can be either private or public.
Public posts can be seen by other users, while private posts can only be seen by the author of that respective post.

belonging to a certain category (for example all that user`s private as well as public posts belonging to the category "cooking"
